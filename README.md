# 📊 User/Opportunity Sign-Up Analysis

## 🚀 Project Overview and Objectives

This project was developed during my internship to analyze user and opportunity sign-up trends with the goal of driving data-informed decision-making. The primary objectives were:

- To uncover patterns in user behavior and sign-up activity.
- To identify factors influencing opportunity participation and conversion rates.
- To surface actionable insights that can enhance user engagement and streamline the onboarding funnel.
- To deliver a professional, interactive dashboard for real-time monitoring of KPIs.

## 📂 Data Sources Used

- **User Sign-Up Data:** Provided by the organization in CSV format, originally exported from internal CRM systems.
- **Opportunity Participation/Completion Data:** Supplied by the internship host organization, based on records extracted from platforms like Salesforce or HubSpot.
- **Activity Logs (optional):** Additional interaction logs (if used) were shared internally by the team in structured files for analysis.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- **Excel:** Used for initial data exploration, cleaning, and formatting.
- **Python:** Leveraged for advanced data preprocessing and analysis using:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `numpy` for numerical operations
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
- **Mockup AI:** Used for designing the dashboard wireframe and layout.
- **Looker Studio (Google Data Studio):** Used to build an interactive, user-friendly dashboard for stakeholders.

## 🔍 Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Extraction:**
   - Pulled structured datasets from CRM and marketing platforms.
   - Standardized into CSV format for processing.

2. **Data Cleaning (Python):**
   - Removed nulls, handled duplicates, and standardized date/time formats.
   - Joined datasets using unique identifiers to form a cohesive dataset.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Identified key sign-up trends by channel, region, and time.
   - Analyzed opportunity participation by demographics and acquisition source.
   - Visualized conversion funnel and sign-up drop-off points.

4. **Wireframing:**
   - Created a structured wireframe to guide dashboard content and layout design.
   - Prioritized clarity, accessibility, and user interaction.

5. **Dashboard Development:**
   - Built the final dashboard in Looker Studio using cleaned datasets.
   - Implemented filters, date ranges, and KPIs for dynamic exploration.

## 📈 Key Findings and Business Insights

- **Sign-Up Peaks:** Mid-week (Tuesdays and Wednesdays) showed the highest sign-up activity.
- **Conversion Bottlenecks:** A notable drop-off was observed between sign-up and qualification stages.
- **Top Channels:** Direct traffic and targeted email campaigns yielded the highest conversion rates.
- **Engagement Window:** Users who interacted with opportunities within the first 72 hours had significantly higher engagement and conversion rates.
